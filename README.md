# HangmanGame
Hangman game simulator (JetBrains Academy's project)

The user should guess the word from the list of words. Initially the user has number of letters only. If the letter was guessed correctly, it appears on the screen instead of underscore ('_')

The script should be started from terminal by: python hangman.py
